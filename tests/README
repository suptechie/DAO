Tests for some of the functionality incorporated in the smart contracts.

Start geth with 
    `geth --networkid 123 --nodiscover --maxpeers 0 --genesis ./genesis_block.json --datadir ./data  console 2>> out.log.geth`
The genesis file has ether assigned to the accounts in ./data/keystore. This provides ether for testing.
To unlock these accounts use "Write here a good, randomly generated, passphrase!" with the double quoates excluded.
Each script does this automatically.

Each script requires the previous scripts to be run successfully first.

deploy.js : Deploys the contract. Creates the dao object. inside geth run loadScript("deploy.js")
fund.js: Finishes the crowd funding by purchasing all the tokens. inside geth run loadScript("fund.js")
new_prop.js: Creates a new proposal inside the dao. inside geth run inside geth run loadScript("new_prop.js")
vote.js: Votes on the new proposal. inside geth run loadScript("vote.js")
